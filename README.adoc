Provides https://fontawesome.com[Font Awesome] for Jenkins Plugins. Font Awesome has vector icons and social logos,
according to their self-perception it is the web's most popular icon set and toolkit. Currently, it contains more than
1,700 free icons.

This plugin contains the SVG sprites of the latest https://fontawesome.com[Font Awesome] 6.x release and corresponding
Jenkins UI elements (model).

== How to use the plugin

Jenkins plugins typically do not use icons very frequently. Most plugins provide an icon for the actions and that's it.
If you intend to use icons in other places, plugin authors are left on their own: the recommended Tango icon set is more
than 10 years old and too limited nowadays. There are several options available, but the most popular is the
https://fontawesome.com[Font Awesome Icon Set]. It provides more than 1700 free icons that follow the same
design guidelines:

In order to use Font Awesome icons in a plugin you simply need add a dependency to the latest version of this plugin:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.jenkins.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>font-awesome-api</artifactId>
  <version>[latest version]</version>
</dependency>
----

Then use the new tag `svg-icon` in your jelly view:

[source,xml,linenums]
.index.jelly
----
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:st="jelly:stapler" xmlns:l="/lib/layout" xmlns:fa="/font-awesome">

  [...]
  <fa:svg-icon name="check-double" class="no-issues-banner"/>
  [...]

</j:jelly>
----

If you are generating views using Java code, then you also can use the class `SvgTag` to generate the
HTML markup for such an icon.
